#stations is a hash - each stop has a name (key) and a 2nd hash as a value, where each key is a transfer point, and each value the number of stops from that transfer point

# Ex:
# L-Line = {
#   "6th Street": {"stop": 1, "transfer-point": {"name": "Union Square", distance: 2}},
#   "8th Street": {"stop": 2, "Union Square": 1},
#   "Union Square": {"stop": 3, "Union Square": 0},
#   "3rd Ave": {"stop": 4, "Union Square": 1},
#   "1st Ave": {"stop": 5, "Union Square": 2},
# }
